# BRING WALDO.

### WHAT IS BRING WALDO.?

Bring Waldo uses a database of locations – bars, cafes, parks, etc – that allow your canine best friend, created through user input. People can upload new places they find with their dogs so others can enjoy even more canine companionship in their own lives.

### Concept

Bring Waldo. came about with my frustrations as well as conversations with other dog parent friends. The web app fills a need in the market – an easy way to find dog-friendly places. Rather than calling ahead or finding out the hard way, people can use Bring Waldo. to easily know whether or not their furry bestie can come.

The web app uses user-input to compile a database of dog-friendly locations and categorize them – bars, coffee, parks and doggie stores – for other dog parents. User-input allows for unofficial and occasional dog-friendly zones as well as the officially designated places to be known and available.
